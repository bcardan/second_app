# A second experiment with the Rails 3.1 Asset Pipeline

Now I'm going to try to create something with enhanced CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, and more.

By that I mean dropping the new twitter-bootstrap-rails gem into the mix and then hopefully pushing this experimental project into stable deployment.

## Thanks
